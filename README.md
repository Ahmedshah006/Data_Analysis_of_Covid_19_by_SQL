# Data_Analysis_of_Covid_19_by_SQL

This SQL script aims to analyze various likelihood scenarios related to COVID-19, utilizing data from a table named 'info'. It includes four distinct queries:

The first query calculates the likelihood of a person dying if infected, grouped by location and ordered by the dead-to-infected ratio in descending order.
The second query calculates the likelihood of a person dying if vaccinated, grouped by location and ordered by the dead-to-vaccinated ratio in descending order.
The third query calculates the likelihood of a person being infected if vaccinated, grouped by location and ordered by the infected-to-vaccinated ratio in descending order.
The fourth query identifies the country with the highest death rate relative to its population, considering the total deaths and population size, and orders the result by the death rate percentage in descending order.
Each query provides valuable insights into different aspects of COVID-19 impact, such as mortality rates, vaccination effectiveness, and the burden of infection relative to population size across different locations.
